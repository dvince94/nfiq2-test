# nfiq2-test

Download nist_plain_tir-ink.yaml(https://github.com/usnistgov/NFIQ2/blob/master/NFIQ2/nist_plain_tir-ink.yaml) and paste it into the Binaries folder to be able to initalize the nifq2 api for the TestNfiqApp and into the Debug directory for the CPlusPlusNfiqTest console app. Copy the Nfiq2Api.dll and Nfiq2Api.pdb from the CPlusPlusNfiqTest/binaries directory and paste it into the Debug Directory, too.
